4.Microblocks & XGO: No Threshold! Journey of Robot Programming



1. What is Microblocks?



Microblocks is an open-source and free graphical programming environment. Its syntax is similar to Scratch, but it can run directly in real time on various microcontrollers (Micro:bit, ESP32/ESP8266, Raspberry PI Pico, etc.).

The official Microblocks comes with the FoxBit development board and the XGO robot dog library, which supports actions, sensors, and AI expansion by simply dragging code blocks.

There is a network environment and no installation is required

If the “Incompatible” prompt appears, please click the gear →「Erase Information and upgrade FoxBit firmware」.

3. Offline Version Installation



Please refer to the previous chapter, “4.2 MicroBlocks IDE”.

4. Quick Tour of Development Environment



Workspace (center) : Drag and drop building blocks, write logic code.

Building Block Library (left) : All blocks are classified by color.

Module Library (lower left) : Add various types of libraries.

Sidebar (right) : Connect to the main board and simulator.

Toolbar (upper left): Switch languages, upgrade firmware, open examples.

5. Add XGO Library to Microblocks



Connect the XGO with the FoxBit development board to the computer, and long press the power button of the XGO to turn it on.

Click 「Connect」→ the corresponing serial port → OK. A small green dot in the status bar indicates that it is connected. The model of the board is FoxBit, and its extension library is automatically displayed on the left side.

In Library → Robot, tick 

XGO-lite

. If there is no XGO blocks, pleasw resart the software or reload the extensions.

8. FAQ



Q1: Cannot connect to the serial port?

A: ① Check whether the data cable supports data transmission; ② Whether 「USB-Serial」 appears in the device manager; ③ Try another ESP32 port.

Q2: XGO makes no responce but no error is reported?

A: You forgot
